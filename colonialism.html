    Do you like spreading freedom? Do you like forcibly spreading freedom? If so 
    then this game is for you! This is a game about forcing your will on unwilling 
    planets in the name of democracy. Even the first couple sentences in the linked 
    trailer has enough satirical rhetoric to make anyone understand satire. 
    The voice lines and overall theme of the game are very on the nose about being a 
    parody of colonialism and fascist. While you should not take the overall theme at face 
    value, you can take the gameplay itself at face value. The core gameplay loop is shooting 
    bugs and robots and completing various missions to level up and get stronger gear. It's a 
    game that has enjoyable gameplay but is an impeccable work of satire if you stop
    to absorb the environment that the developers have put you in.
