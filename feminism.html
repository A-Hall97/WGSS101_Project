            “Feminism is a struggle to end sexist oppression. Therefore, it is necessarily a 
            struggle to eradicate the ideology of domination that permeates Western culture on 
            various levels, as well as a commitment to reorganizing society so that the 
            self-development of people cantake precedence over imperialism, economic expansion, 
            and material desires.”</p>

    Horizon Zero Dawn's main character Aloy was the subject of backlash from the 
    misogynistic portion of the gaming community. The backlash was the result of her 
    being a woman in a non male-dominated world. To them this is too far fetched even 
    for a fantasy world which is a contradictory opinion to have. This is why she has 
    become a feminist icon in the gaming community. To quote Rory Dickenson "feminism is 
    struggle to end sexist oppression." Strong women exist in real life, and they exist 
    in fourth wave feminism in the form of video games too.
