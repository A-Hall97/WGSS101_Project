        Celeste is a game about Madeline, a young woman who decides to climb Celeste Mountain.
        What begins as a journey of self-determination, it turns into a narrative about 
        mental-health, self-discovery, and acceptance. Along the way she encounters a mirror
        image of herself named "Badeline" who seems to be a representation of her
        self-doubt. It's a beautiful introspective narrative with challenging gameplay to match the 
        challenging theme of self-acceptance.
