    <p style="margin:40px;font-size:26px;text-align:left;text-indent:40px;line-height:2;flex-wrap:wrap;">The idea of the nuclear
    family was idealized by post WW2 America. A mother and father, 2 kids, and
    a white picket fence is what comes to mind when you read these words. Stephanie
    Coontz refers to this as "the nostalgia trap," or the way we never were. The Sims
    series as a whole has been a game that challenges that. Of course you can still
    make your nuclear family if you want to, but you can also make it whatever you want. 
    As a stalwart of the sandbox genre, you can represent yourself however you'd like. 
    The only restrictions on relationships is being limited to a single partner, but
    there are mods out there for that for those who want it. This game challenges the ideas 
    of heteronormative relationships by giving freedom to the player to shape their 
    experience that fits them the best. As Blair Imani says, "part of getting smarter 
    about family means being aware of the incredible diversity of family structures, 
    and not making assumptions about them." The Sims 4 is smarter about family.</p>
