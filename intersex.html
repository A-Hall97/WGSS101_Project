            assessment. It would be better for intersexuals and their supporters to turn everyone's focus

    Baldur's Gate 3 is one of the most inclusive games in recent times. There is a wide array of 
    representation in this game from the way they allow you to customize your character, to the people you 
    meet along your journey. The focal point of the game is on the actions of the player, instead of who 
    you are as the player. The inclusive approach of the Baldur's Gate 3 developers has expanded to the 
    modding community as well. Many of the large modding sites have outright banned mods that replace characteristics
    that bigots don't agree with. While you can't argue with these morons, you can prevent them from spreading
    their hate. It's been really refreshing everyone from the developers, to the community of this game since it's
    launch come together to ensure the inclusivity of this game is unhindered. Keeping the focus off of the 
    genitals and acknowledge that these people exist is great to see.
